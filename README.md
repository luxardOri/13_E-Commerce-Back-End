This is a project to familiarize myself with setting up an e-commerce back end. We created a database with different api routes to get data, create new records, update data, and delete items.

## Installation

Step 1: log into mysql and run: 

```
source db/schema.sql
```
Step 2: In your terminal, run:  

```
npm i

npm run seed

npm start
```
Step 3: Once everything is installed, db is seeded, and you start the application, you can use insomnia to run all the api routes. There's a walk through in the Usage section to show you how.
